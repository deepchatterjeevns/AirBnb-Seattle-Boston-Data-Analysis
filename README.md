# AirBnb Seattle Boston Data Analysis
Comparative analysis of Seattle and Boston Airbnb data as part of first project in Udacity [Data Science Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025?utm_source=gsem_brand&utm_medium=ads_r&utm_campaign=1971936383_c&utm_term=71052942655_in&utm_keyword=data%20science%20nanodegree_e&gclid=CjwKCAjwhOD0BRAQEiwAK7JHmCGAF_4t98BQrSr15xtEoTHGgQClJcxIjMSuXe1bIjIYcABU70NKKhoC0j4QAvD_BwE).

## Project Motivation
The goal of this project is to analyze the Seattle and Boston Airbnb data and to find out what are some of the key important features with respect  to lising price
I have tried to answer below three questions through data analysis  
  - Q.1 When are the peak season to visit Seattle and Boston?
  - Q2. How did some features like the neighborhood, no. of bedrooms, etc affect the price?
  - Q3. Using Machine Learning, which features are more important related to pricing?

## File Description
  - Data files: [Seattle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle) Listing and Calendar Dataset and [Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston) Listing And Calendar                   Dataset
  - Jupyter Notebooks: Seattle_Boston_AirBnb_Analysis.ipynb combined both the datasets for comparative study, Airbnb_Seattle.ipynb ML on Seattle dataset, Airbnb_Boston_ML.ipynb ML on Boston Dataset

## Libraries required
  - Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Scikit-Learn

## Summary result

Answer: Best time to visit Seattle is June to August and Best time to visit Boston is Setember-October.

Q2. How did some features like the neighborhood, no. of bedrooms, etc affect the price?
Answer: Yes, features like number of bedrooms etc.do affect listing price

Q3. Using Machine Learning, which features are more important related to pricing?
Answer: Using Machine learning top important feature for Seattle is number of bedrooms and for Boston is Private roon in room_type feature.

I have posted a detailed analysis on Medium here.
